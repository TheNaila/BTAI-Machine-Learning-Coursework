This time we will do something different. Just as we can pass a Pipeline object directly to `plot_roc_curve()` to evaluate the model, we can pass `grid_search_LR.best_estimator_` to the function `plot_roc_curve()` to evaluate the model. We also pass in the test data (`X_test` and `y_test`). This allows the test data to be passed through the entire pipeline, using the best hyperparameter values.\n",
